The project plan details the intended structure of the project and shows 
that some thought went into the technology and library choices. A connection
between the libraries and the game logic is not present in the plan. The plan 
is clear and has a good idea about what can be done in the given time. The 
division of work is done on a high level, but could be more detailed and tell 
also about the working practices.

Grade for the project plan: 4
