Design: 4
The design choices are sensible and use appropriate features. Some more advanced C++ features might have been useful to make the code clearer.

Working practices: 2
Git commits are somewhat sensible, but branching is not used quite correctly. Work log is good. Testing of the software is not documented.

Implementation: 2
CMake is used and enables building for multiple platforms. The program sometimes crashes when starting a level. Some uninitalized values are present when running the program. 

Topical features: 4
All the basic features have been implemented and in addition some additional features have been implemented too.
